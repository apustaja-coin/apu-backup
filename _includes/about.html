                <p>Apu, also known as Peepo or Helper, is a pepe-variant that is used to represent a much younger, kinder and more naive anthropomorphic frog.</p>
                <p>Fed up with low-effort memecoins, more often than not led by deceptive developers, Apu decided to create his own fairly launched, fully transparent coin: $APU â€“ the one and only coin for all frens.</p>
                <p>Having already conquered the internet and the hearts of millions of people, Apu is now on his way to conquer the cryptosphere. If you consider yourself a fren, feel free to join us on this amazing ride to the only place where a character like Apu belongs to: the moon.</p>
